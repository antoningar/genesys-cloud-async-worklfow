		main sample as common thread
            to identify a caller thanks to his calling number, we need to do multiple rest call to different webservices
            to do that, two options : waiting call execution one after another or create a webservices to paralellise calls and waiting his call execution
            my new option is to parralelize this calls inside geneys and let the customer go through his journey during the execution
            no need any external dependencies or development, everything in genesys
